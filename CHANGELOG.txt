Version 0.3.0 RPG Update
01 Feb 2018
--------------------------------------------------
Description: Third major version of the game.
This update will introduce many features typical of
an RPG game, such as levels, defense values, a basic
economy and NPCs, as well as customizable options

Data:
- Additions: Items now have a new data member "value" to add (Default value of item in shop)
- Additions: Mobs now have a new data member "gold" to add (Amount it will drop on death)
- Changes: Item type should now be placed before the name

Options:
- Additions: New file for custom starting options like map size, position of magical potion/player, max time to complete game

NPCs:
- Additions: New file for creating NPCs in the game (Only the merchant for now)
Notes: Merchants can have a maximum of 9 inventory slots

Gameplay:
- Additions: Items can now be inspected to yield a description (To be expanded on in future Events update)
- Additions: Players now have exp and levels that scale their stats
- Additions: Attack value of attacker is compared to defence value of defender to determine effective damage
(^^ Atk and def must be defined to be at least 1)
- Additions: Items now have a functioning success rate (Can now fail to be used)
- Additions: Mobs now drop gold and exp
- Additions: There is now a merchant NPC that will buy and sell items (Basic trading)
- Additions: Unusable item types (Can only be sold)
- Additions: Game now tells the player what his/her roll on whether his/her use of item is successful is (Not for running)
- Changes: UI Overhaul, with more sub-menus for each type of action as opposed to a specific number for each specific action
- Changes: Game now prints map after defeating a mob
- Changes: Changed text describing number of uses left for an item
- Changes: Minor text alignment changes
- Fixes: Typo when printing that player will constantly take damage while on same tile as a threat
- Fixes: Undefined behaviour when choosing an item slot with an item that is not a healing item in encounter with threat
- Fixes: Player character did not appear on screen after defeating a mob, then checking surroundings
- Fixes: Player can try to move right or down out of the map, resulting in a crash
- Fixes: Picking up the magical potion resulted in the game displaying as having medicine in the inventory
- Fixes: Inputting invalid option in swap item menu, game returns to movement/inventory/etc menu without telling user
- Fixes: Game did not print player position if player chooses to go back from swap item menu
- Fixes: Threat can no longer spawn on the same tile as the magical potion

Additional notes:
- Initial values of player's atk and def can be changed in Data.dat but currently the levelled up values are fixed
- If the player starts with more than 5 exp, the level will not updated until the player gains some exp
- The current atk/def algorithm needs work, a simple one has currently been implemented as a trial
- Position of merchant is not checked if it has a conflict with other merchants/players
- There is a chance that if the number of entities to be generated is directly equal to that of the mapsize, and the last
entity to be generated is a threat, and the last tile without an entity is the magical potion, game could infinite loop (unconfirmed)
- All these will be fixed in a future update

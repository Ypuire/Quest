Version 0.4.1 Time Patch
30 Mar 2018
--------------------------------------------------
Description: Patch that revises the main flow of the
game. Instead of switching back and forth between
player and the non-player's turn, now uses a time system
that iterates through every (by default) 0.25 days, so
mobs/threats can have a properly defined attack frequency
and the time taken for each player's move can be adjusted

Data:
- Additions: Mobs and threats now have an attack frequency (in days)

Options:
- Additions: Time interval between each update can be changed in Options.dat
- Additions: First encounter reaction time (For mobs) can now be changed in Options.dat
- Additions: Time taken for each individual action (Move, use item, check surroundings, run) can now be changed in Options.dat

Gameplay:
- Changes: Swapping items now take the same amount of time as using an item (0.25days)
- Changes: Game is now executed by running through in-game time in pre-defined (defualt 0.25days) time intervals,
then deciding if anything is to be executed in this time

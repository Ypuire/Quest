- If the player starts with more than 5 exp, the level will not updated until the player gains some exp
- The current atk/def algorithm needs work, a simple one has currently been implemented as a trial
- Position of merchant is not checked if it has a conflict with other merchants/players
- There is a chance that if the number of entities to be generated is directly equal to that of the mapsize, and the last
entity to be generated is a threat, and the last tile without an entity is the magical potion, game could infinite loop (unconfirmed)
- All these will be fixed in a future update

Version 0.3.1 Code Patch

--------------------------------------------------
Description: Small patch with a few minor fixes,
mostly not intended to add or change features,
focuses on rebuilding some parts of the game with

Description: Patch that revises the main flow of the
game. Instead of switching back and forth between

and the time taken for each player's move can be adjusted

then deciding if anything is to be executed in this time
